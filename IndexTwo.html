                <p>Life is a journey filled with love, pain, joy, sorrow, happiness and sadness. It is filled with multiple emotional feelings that we will most likely experience in one way or the other in our lifetime. These emotions will give you a lifetime worth of teaching, so we should take each lesson and learn from it and cheerish no matter how happy or sad you are. Rise above your sadness, pain and sorrow and find joy, love and happiness.</p>

                <p>Enjoy your life to the fullest until the day you die. Life is too short to be worrying about each and every single detail. A person's life is more than that and this is why you should cheerish the life that was given to you. The past is HISTORY, tomorrow is a MYSTERY, but today is a GIFT that is why it is known as the present. Live a life of purpose filled with a lot of meaning. LIVE LOVE LAUGH.</p>
